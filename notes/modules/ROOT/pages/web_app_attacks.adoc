= Web App attacks

== Web App Enumeration

=== Manually

Enumeration can use page content, debugger for response headers, inspecting `robots.txt` & `sitemap.xml`, as well as admin consoles (phpmyadmin or tomcat)

=== Tooling

==== DIRB

`dirb <URL> -r -z 10` non-recursive with 10ms delay between requests

==== Nikto

`nikto -host=<domain> -maxtime=Xs` will scan for X seconds. It is important to fine tune nikto with `-T`

== Web app exploitation

=== Admin consoles
